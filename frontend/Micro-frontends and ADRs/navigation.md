Navigation micro-frontend

## Context

Due to high repetition in most of the apps' screens, this component requires high reusability, and so can be considered one micro-frontend. Due to being in a lot of screens, this feature is highly crucial for the app development, and should be worked by a singular team.
By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

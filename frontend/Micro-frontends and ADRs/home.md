Home micro-frontend

## Context

This micro front-end includes the app header, the search bar to search for supermarkets and the display of products.
These funcionalities can be considered to pose as an introduction to the application, so it makes sense to be considered a
micro frontend and to be developed by the same team, that can dedicate their efforts to make the home menu as pleasant and helpful as possible.
This guarentees simplicity and also requires high reusability since the app header is used in multiple screens of the application and the product's display view is used in the main menu and in the saved products menu.
By giving these funcionalities to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

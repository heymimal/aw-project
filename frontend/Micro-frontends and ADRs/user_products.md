# Title

User Products micro-frontend

## Context

This micro frontend consists on a view of the saved products of a user.
This view is used on this micro frontend and this screen, but also in the home menu.
So, having the same team developing this component ensures simplicity and flexibility, because we are giving
a specific task to a specific team, for a view that is used in another screen of the application, and only the logic 
of its implementation and using has to be modified.
By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, allowing the
application to display the products with the same display, ensuring consistency.

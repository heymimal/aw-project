Product details

## Context
This micro-frontend displays the products information. it provides a picture of the product, and multiple information regarding the product's price, type, and origin. It allows the user to see more information regarding the product, and also see feedback from other users. The user can also save the product to his User Products, and provide feedback about the product.
Due to this being a highly re-usable frontend, as all products in the app will have to display information, it makes sense for it to be a micro-frontend as its needed for multiple products, and so can provide high reusability and flexibility for the developers.

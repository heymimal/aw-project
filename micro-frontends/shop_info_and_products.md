Shop Info And Products

## Context
This micro-frontend provides information regarding which shop's information is being displayed.
It displays a map to show where the store is located, as well has display where different product types are shown. On interaction with these displays, a new view pops up that provides not only the shop information, but also the specific product type being presented, some highlighted products regarding that specific product type, and all products of that type in the current store. Due to all of this being a specific part of the application, we believe it makes sense for it to be a 
micro-frontend to display the shop information and products, and an autonomous team doing it will lead to better results.

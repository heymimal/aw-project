# Title

QR Code micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

This component should be developed by a single team (single responsability), so we don't have multiples teams developing the same component, which can cause problems after or make teams deal with different problems unnecessarily (simplicity).


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, making the QR Code funcionality as good and workable as possible.

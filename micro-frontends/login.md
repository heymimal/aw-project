# Title

Login micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

This component will be used by everyone using the app, so in order to achieve simplicity, it would be better to alocate just a team to deal with all the matters related to the login component, so everyone on the team is into the development, and there aren't multiple teams dealing with the same component, and possibly dealing with different issued during the development.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, making the login funcionality as good and workable as possible.

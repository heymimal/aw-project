# Title

Provide feedback

## Status


## Context

This part allows users to provide feedback regarding a specific product, by clicking on a star grading and submitting it.

Due to being a simple display, that will be used in every product page, and due to that being highly reusable, this micro frontend should be developed by a single autonomous team.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

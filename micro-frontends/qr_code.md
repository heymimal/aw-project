QR Code micro-frontend

## Context

This component can be used to access information of a product.
This component should be developed by a single team (single responsability), so we don't have multiples teams developing the same component, which can cause problems after or make teams deal with different problems unnecessarily (simplicity).
By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, making the QR Code funcionality as good and workable as possible.
This also ensures flexibility.

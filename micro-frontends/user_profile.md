# Title

User profile

## Status


## Context
Due to how this part of the app relates to how the user can visualize and see their's account information, and how this specific part is focused on the user's account, we believe it makes sense for a team to only focus on this component.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results. (?)

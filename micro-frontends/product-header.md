# Title

Product Header micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

This component requires simplicity and flexibity, since it is used on the product's screen, either showing the product's details
or the product's feedback at the same time, so it makes sense to be the same team to develop the format of the product's header/photo.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

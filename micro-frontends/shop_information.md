# Title

Shop information

## Status


## Context

This part provides information regarding which shop's information is being displayed, and which product's type are being presented. This, alongside two other micro-frontends, makes a page regarding a shops product.

Due to being a simple display, that could be used in future parts of the app, and due to that being highly reusable, this micro frontend should be developed by a single autonomous team.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

# Title

Statistical Information Display

## Status


## Context

This part of the app intends to display information regarding animal consuption, and the positive and negative sides to it. Due to being a simple representation of the information, we believe a single team could focus on this part of the app, to make it a micro-frontend.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

# Title

Supermarket Search micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

To develop this component, we can work with autonomous teams or vertical services, while working on the same screen as other teams,
since this search funcionality is independent to the development of the other components on the screen. This also guarantees flexibility since we have different teams working with different components.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

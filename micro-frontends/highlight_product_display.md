# Title

Highlighted Product Display

## Status


## Context

This part represents some highlighted products according to a specific store and a specific product type, by the user's provided feedback. In it, the users can navigate to the right or left to see the product, and by clicking a button in the image they can see the product's details.

This, alongside two other micro-frontends, makes a page regarding a shops product.



## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.


## DISCUSS
maybe this could be fused with the shop information frontend??


## Consequences
By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

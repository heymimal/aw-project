# Title

Product Display micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

This component requires high reusability, since it is used in the main menu and in the saved products menu.
Having the same team developing this component also ensures simplicity and flexibility, because we are giving
a specific task to a specific team, and this component can then be used in multiple screens, making the app consistent.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, allowing the 
application to display the products with the same display, ensuring consistency.

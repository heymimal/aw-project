News display micro-frontend


## Context

This component consists on the display of news.
This component should be developed by a single team (single responsability), so we don't have multiples teams developing the same component, which can cause problems after or make teams deal with different problems unnecessarily (simplicity). 
This also guarantees flexibility.
By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results, making the news display component look the most presentable and organized for users as possible.

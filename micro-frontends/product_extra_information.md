# Title

Product extra information

## Status


## Context

Due to the simplicity of this screen, which displays additional information regarding a specific product, most specifically by presenting a table, and due to the need for this component to be re-used for multiple products, we believe that by making this a micro-frontend, our app will have more flexibility.


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results. As it is a simple micro frontend, the team responsible for this could also focus on a similar micro frontend, the product expanded info.

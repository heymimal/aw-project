# Title

App Header micro-frontend

## Status

??

## Context

This component requires high reusability, since it is used in multiple screens of the application, being considered a micro-frontend. This also makes the app development more simple (the component being developed by the same team).


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above?

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.

# Title

All products display

## Status


## Context

This part displays some information regarding all the products of a certain type in a specific store, to provide the users in a quick glance what the store offers. This, alongside two other micro-frontends, makes a page regarding a shops product.

Due to being a simple display, that could be used in future parts of the app, and how it needs to be used for other shop's products display, making it a microfrontend helps in making it a part of the app with high reusability


## Decision

This micro-frontend will be developed by a single team due to the reasons above.

## Consequences

By giving this functionality to a team, the team can focus on a single responsability and provide better results.
